# Range Search Algorithms

This project implements and compares different range searching algorithms in C++.

## Structure
- `src/`: Source files for algorithm implementations and main program
- `include/`: Header files
- `tests/`: Unit and performance tests
- `docs/`: Documentation

## Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./range_search
```

## Algorithms
- KD-Tree
- Range Tree
- Quad Tree
- (Add more as needed)
